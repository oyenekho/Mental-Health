  <div class="homeContent">
    <p class="homeContentItem"><span class="highlight">Mental health impacts everyone</span>. Yes, everyone. Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, and it needs to be taken care of. The mind is a complex thing that deals with a plethora of emotions that we all have to sort through. However, that can be straining. Finding the proper tools to deal with mental health issues is difficult, especially for marginalized groups. Access to resources is also limited for many people.</p>

    <p class="homeContentItem">Mental health is just as important as physical health, seeing as the two affect each other. For example, depression increases the risk of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Likewise, poor physical health can lead to poor mental health. Having physical limitations on your body can lead to greater stress and/or depression. One does not trump the other. It is important to <span class="highlight">take care of both aspects of yourself</span> to imrove your overall health and quality of life.</p>

    <p class="homeContentItem">It is important to note that <span class="highlight">poor mental health and mental illness are not the same</span>. One does not equal the other. Experiencing poor mental health does not mean that a person is also facing mental illness. Likewise, a person experiencing mental illness can experience periods of mental well-being. Mental illnesses are clinically diagnosed whereas poor mental health is not. Many people mistake poor mental health as serious mental illnesses and that is a harmful practice. <span class="highlight">Self diagnoses cause more harm</span> than any good. They can lead to stress and depression caused by unnecessary panic, as well as serious medical risks. The practice of self diagnosis might also lead to self treatment where people end up treating themselves incorrectly and harming themselves. Being <span class="highlight">safe</span> in all areas of your life is important, especially when it comes to your health.</p>
